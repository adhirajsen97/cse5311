a) Aggregate Method

With the aggregate method, analyze the total cost of n operations and divide by n.

For insertion into a dynamic table:
- The resizing happens when the table size is 1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^k
- Each resize costs O(i) where i is the current number of elements
- Total cost for n insertions = n (basic insertions) + 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ... + n/2 (resizing costs)
- The sum 1 + 2 + 4 + ... + n/2 is bounded by 2n for a geometric series with ratio 2
- Total cost = n + O(n) = O(n)

Therefore, the amortized cost per operation is O(n)/n = O(1).

b) Accounting Method

For the accounting method, we assign a charge to each operation:
- Charge 3 units per insertion (this is our amortized cost)
- Use 1 unit for the actual insertion
- Bank 2 units as credit on the element

When table doubling occurs:
- We need to move i elements at a cost of i
- We have 2i units of stored credit (2 units Ã— i elements)
- The stored credit covers the cost of copying

The amortized cost per insertion is O(1).
