Hands-On 2

Implement:

1. insertion sort

2. selection sort

3. bubble sort

 

In the discussion:

1. Post a link to your github repository(s) with the source code.

2. Argue selection sort correctness.

3. Benchmark the runtime of each algorithm. Your benchmarks should include information about your computer (ram, cpu etc.) and be run with various input sizes; from small (array of size 5,10,20) all the way up to large arrays (where your computer is struggling). I should at the very least see a plot of time vs input size n. Feel free to use benchmarking software.

1) The file, sortingAlgorithms.py" contains all 3 required sorting algorithms: Selection, Bubble and Insertion Sort.

2) random arrays with increasing sizes are generated and saved with their corresponding run times to an external csv, "sortingRuntTimes.csv" file

3) The file, "sortingRuntTimes.csv",  will then be analyzed and visualised in another python noteboook further
